Using CookieCutter for your plug
-----------------------------------

    $ pip install cookiecutter
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/jo-nas/openhtf_plug_template.git

You will be asked about your basic info (name, project name, app name, etc.).
This info will be used in your new plug.


Goals
-----

The goal of this project is simply to take some of the boiler plate out of creating a new plug for the OpenHTF Framework.
It is intended to stay pretty minimal, but contains everything needed to make a project that includes:

 * Installable via pip
 * Testing via pytest
 * basic travic ci configuration
 
Contributing
------------

The intent of this project is to stay fairly lean, but if you have any suggestions or would like to help out, please let me know.
